# Client_to_Client
A 3 client communication.
1.)My assumption is that only one client and server talk to each other in the first question (Server to Server communication).
2.)In the second question, we assume that the three clients have first connected themselves to the server and later each client is addressing the other client through an input field of 'Username  : Message '.
3.)Also, we assume that each client has to take turns and send the required data to the other clients.All the clients must act i.e Each client has to give an input in every case either of the clients or to herself/himself.
The server checks for reply from each side and does the required transfer.
It is very important to note that the message in the buffer can be retrieved by pressing 'Enter' key.
4.)Additionally, each client also has the option to broadcast.The syntax changedis only 'broadcast: Message'.
This will be like a board room meeting where contribution from each client will matter.It can also be used for games/game room chats like poker/card games.
